## Introduction
I am currently studying JAMstack Frontend Web Development with The Coders Guild and I’ve been retaining myself within web development for the past year. 

I have over 16 years of work experience in the charity sector, managing youth projects and leading teams. For the past four years I have been self-employed as an events coordinator, working with a large international charity, leasing with marketing and engagement teams. 

I have gained many soft skills and strengths that would benefit many companies and teams. I would describe myself as approachable, friendly & easy to get along with. I’m a creative problem solver that thrives with new challenges and stays calm under pressure. I have a great desire to keep learning, developing and growing both as a person and professionally.
