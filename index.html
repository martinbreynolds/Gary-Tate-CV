  <h3>My Web Development Journey</h3>
  <p>My Web Development journey probably started much later in life them most people. 
    Even though I've previously made loads of websites using WIX, I wouldn't have called 
    myself a Web Developer. Like most people running their own business, I became a dab 
    hand at making a great looking WIX website. But I quickly learnt that my websites on 
    WIX were very limited. My Web Development journey really started this year while in lockdown 
    due to Covid-19. Having lost all my work due to every single event being cancelled, I started 
    to look at alternative opportunities. I had already been working on some Website and realised 
    that I needed to learn more about coding to be able to get more out of the Website that I had 
    created. So, I began learning as much as I could about HTMl, CSS and JavaScript and on the 1st 
    June I started my first online Udemy course called The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and 
    for the next 2 months, I plan to spend as much time as possible learning all I can about Website 
    building, development and design. I hope to have lots of great website examples up for you to 
    view soon.</p>
