  <h3>My Web Development Journey</h3>
  <p>My Website Development journey probably started much later in life them most peoples.  
    Even though I've previousley made loads of websites using WIX for must of previouse 
    employent and while I was running a self-employed events business, I wouldn't have called
    myself a Web Developer. Like must people running their own buisness, I became a dab hand
    at making a great looking WIX webiste. But I quickly found my websites on WIX very 
    limited. My Website Delevlopment journey really started at the age of 40 and while 
    in lockdown due to Covid-19. Having lost all my work due to every single event being 
    cacnled, I started to look at alternative oppertunties. I had already been working on 
    some Website and realeased that I needed to learn more about coding to be able to get
    more out of the Website that I had created. So, I begain learning as much as I could 
    about HTMl, CSS and JavaScript and on the 1st June I started my onlone Unedy course 
    called The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and for the next 2 mounths I spend
    more them 10 hours a day learning as much as I could about Building and Developing 
    amazing Website. You can see samples of my work by visiting my work page.</p>
